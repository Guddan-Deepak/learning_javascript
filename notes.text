JavaScript is a dynamically typed language.

->Type Checking at Runtime: The data type of a variable in JavaScript is determined at runtime, not at compile time.
This means you don't explicitly declare the type of a variable when you create it.
example:
    let myVariable = 10; // myVariable is a number
    myVariable = "hello"; // myVariable can now be a string
